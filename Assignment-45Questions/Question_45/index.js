// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function createCar(manufacturer, model, options) {
    let car = { manufacturer, model };
    if (options) {
        for (let key in options) {
            car[key] = options[key];
        }
    }
    return car;
}
let car = createCar("Toyota", "Honda", { color: "white", year: 2020, optionalFeature: "sunroof" });
console.log(car);
